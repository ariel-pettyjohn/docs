# OP Stack Genesis Creation

The following guide shows you how to generate the L2 allocs. This is a JSON
file that represents the L2 genesis state. You will provide this file to the
execution client (op-geth) to initialize your network.

## Solidity Script

At the time of this writing, the preferred method for genesis generation is to use the foundry script located in the monorepo. It can be found at
[packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/L2Genesis.s.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/L2Genesis.s.sol).

### Configuration

Create or modify a file `<network-name>.json` inside the `deploy-config`
folder in the monorepo. The script will read the latest active fork from the
deploy config and the L2 genesis allocs generated will be compatible with this
fork. The automatically detected fork can be overwritten by setting the
environment variable `FORK` either to the lower-case fork name (currently
`delta`, `ecotone`, or `fjord`) or to `latest`, which will select the latest fork
available (currently `fjord`).

By default, the script will dump the L2 genesis allocs of the detected or
selected fork only, to the file at `STATE_DUMP_PATH`. The optional environment
variable `OUTPUT_MODE` allows you to modify this behavior by setting it to one of
the following values:

*   `latest` (default) - only dump the selected fork's allocs.
*   `all` - also dump all intermediary fork's allocs. This only works if
    `STATE_DUMP_PATH` is not set. In this case, all allocs will be written to files
    `/state-dump-<fork>.json`. Another path cannot currently be specified for this
    use case.
*   `none` - won't dump any allocs. Only makes sense for internal test usage.

### Creation

*   `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES_PATH` represents the deployment artifact that was
    generated during a contract deployment.
*   `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH` represents a path on the filesystem that points to a
    deployment config. The same deploy config JSON file should be used for L1 contracts
    deployment as when generating the L2 genesis allocs.
*   `STATE_DUMP_PATH` represents the filepath at which the allocs will be
    written to on disk.

```bash
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES_PATH=deployments/artifact.json \
DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH=<PATH_TO_MY_DEPLOY_CONFIG> \
STATE_DUMP_PATH=<PATH_TO_WRITE_L2_ALLOCS> \
  forge script scripts/L2Genesis.s.sol:L2Genesis \
  --sig 'runWithStateDump()'
```

## Subcommand (op-node genesis l2)

Historically, the genesis file creation was handled by the `genesis l2`
subcommand, provided by the `op-node`. The following is an example of its usage
from [v1.7.6](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/v1.7.6).

```bash
go run cmd/main.go genesis l2 \
  --deploy-config=<Path to deploy config file> \
  --l1-deployments value=<Path to L1 deployments JSON file as in superchain-registry> \
  --outfile.l2=<Path to L2 genesis output file: i.e. ./genesis.json> \
  --outfile.rollup=<Path to rollup output file: i.e. ./rollup.json> \
  --l1-rpc=<RPC URL for an Ethereum L1 node. Cannot be used with --l1-starting-bloc>>
```

Alternatively, you can omit `--l1-rpc` and use `--l1-starting-block`. This option
lets you provide a path to a JSON file containing the L1 starting block. This
overrides the need for using an L1 RPC to fetch the block. It cannot be used
with `--l1-rpc`.
