# Rollup Configuration

New OP Stack blockchains are currently configured with a JSON file inside the
Optimism repository. You can see example configurations in the
[deploy-config directory](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config).

<Callout type="warning">
  The Rollup configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve
  significantly as time goes on. If something isn't working about your
  configuration, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-chain-ops/genesis/config.go).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Standard configuration is the set of requirements for an OP Stack chain to be
  considered a Standard Chain within the superchain. These requirements are
  currently a draft, pending governance approval. For more details, please see
  this [governance thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135).
